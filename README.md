### What is this repository for?
Do you want to apply to your dream company's internship position
as soon as they post it on their careers page?
This program is for you. It automatically crawls the specified
page - e.g. `https://careers.myDreamCompany.com` - for specific keywords
- `Software Engineering Internship (Summer)` - and then sends
you an email as soon the company posts the position.

<br>

### Context
I made this so that I can apply to my dream company's summer internship
position as soon as they post it on their website.
The problem this program aims to solve is that, even though
we roughly know when a specific company posts internship
positions, we can't exactly know when.
