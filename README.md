### What is this repository for?
Do you want to apply to your dream company's internship position
as soon as they post it on their careers page?
This program is for you. It automatically crawls the webpage you
specify, such as `https://careers.myDream.com`, looks for specific
keywords `Software Engineering Internship (Summer)`, and then
sends you an email as soon as it's posted.

<br>

### Context
I made this so that I can apply to my dream company's summer internship
position as soon as they post it on their website.
The problem this program was created to solve was that, even though
we roughly know when a specific company posts internship
positions, it's almost often the case that we don't exactly know when.

This program aims to give you a peace of mind. It allows you to be among the
first ones to apply. It will notify you that the position has been posted on your
dream company's careers page. It will not, however, do anything else.
Obviously, you still have to fill in all applications stuff,
write a good cover letter, etc.
